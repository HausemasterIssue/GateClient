# Gate Client
Gate Client is a *Forge Mod for Minecraft 1.12.2* developed by **TheF1xer** that started for fun as a way to learn how to code in Java. Right now this Mod is on a very early stage of development but is continuously being updated.

The development of this Mod started in October 2020 and went public in January 2021 when a config system was finally implemented.

## Objective
This Utility Mod is a Client-Side Mod that is only available for Forge for Minecraft 1.12.2 and takes inspiration from many other open-source clients, but every single line was written for this Mod.

Help will be always well received, so if you find something that could be changed let me know. New Modules will be implemented as soon as possible and the existing ones will be updated regularly.

## Usage
You can get the latest version of **Gate Client** in the [Release Page](https://github.com/TheF1xer/GateClient/releases/latest). Then you have to download the **.jar** file at the end of that page and run it using *Forge* for Minecraft 1.12.2.

To actually interact with the Client you have to either press **Right Shift** ingame to open the **Click GUI** or use commands (the default prefix is "**.**"), type "**.help**" to get a list of all of them.
